# computerCraft-installScript
a bash install script to install ComputerCraft on a linux box (only tested ubuntu).

# why
I had a hard time finding out how to install a server for ComputerCraft. I made this script, maybe others find it handy...

# what it does
This bash script will install a ComputerCraft server on a linux box. You only need this script. The script will download the neccesary jars and install them in a sub dir. After this script has run (about a minute) you will have your ComputerCraft server up and running.

# prerequisites
A version of *java* needs to be pre-installed.

# what it uses
The following software is installed:
- [https://mcversions.net/](minecraft) *1.7.10*
- [http://files.minecraftforge.net/](forge) *10.13.2.1230*
- [http://www.computercraft.info/](ComputerCraft) *1.65*
